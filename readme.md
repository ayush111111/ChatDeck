# ChatDeck

This extension creates Anki flashcards from LLM conversations.

## Motivation
Though the use of flashcards has been extensively studied, very few people actually use them, possibly because of the high effort required to create them.
Using LLMs this effort can be reduced significantly
By plugging this extension into the pre-existing Anki ecosystem (AnkiWeb,AnkiDesktop, AnkiDroid), retaining information using flashcard on-the-go becomes easy

## Novelty

Analyzes follow-up questions as indicators of learning priorities.
